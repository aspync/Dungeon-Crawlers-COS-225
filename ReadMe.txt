This program is for a text-based RPG Dungeon-Crawler type game. The player inputs information in the console to make choices in the game, such as where to go, when to attack, and when to heal. This game is also set on insanity difficulty. Think Dark Souls, but text-based. Good luck trying to beat it ;)
