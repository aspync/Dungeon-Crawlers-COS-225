Our project will be a Dungeon Crawler. The goal is to defeat the bosses to collect keys.
Our dungeon crawler will have many different classes that the user can choose from. The map will include several enviroments with different buffs/debuffs.

Tundra- 1 cold damage for 1 room away, 2 for 2 rooms, etc.
Desert- FIRST BOSS == SPHYNX, must answer RIDDLES
Swamp- drop items? UNDECIDED
Lava- certain stepping stones, no buffs, one room results in instakill
Clouds- reduce damage by half
Forest - set up into a maze, the trees are trickery

Each character (including the monsters) will have HP, Attack, Defense, Strength, and Items.

HP -- health, will be carried over
Defense -- +2, etc damage taken decrease
Attack -- damage dealt
Strength -- +2, etc damage attack increase
Items -- items can increase or decrease any of the 4 stats
Keys -- keys are undroppable and can be carried forever once picked up

List of possible items to collect:

sword - +2 attack
health ring +2 HP
shield +2 defense
magic hat +1 to all stats

How we will incorporate the requirements:
Map will be read from a file, while the scoreboard will be outputted to a file (and high scores).
Classes/objects will be used to generate characters and character classes.
Command line arguments/ user input in console will be used for a CONTINUE function, a code will be given at checkpoints that can then be inputed.
Error catching will be used with both try-catch blocks for files, and if statements for certain situations.
We will use data structure by using a linked list for the map.
Overloading functions will be used as needed.
