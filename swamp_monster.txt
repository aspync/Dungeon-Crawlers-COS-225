Jenny Greenteeth

British folklore warns that passing by a marsh on a misty evening means risking an encounter with Jenny Greenteeth, a sharp-
toothed crone who pulls unwary wanderers into the depths and devours them. Even today in parts of England, “Jenny Greenteeth”
is another name for the duckweeds (Lemna sp.), aquatic plants whose tiny leaves form a continuous mat over the water’s surface that
may appear as solid ground to the eyes of the very young or very old.
